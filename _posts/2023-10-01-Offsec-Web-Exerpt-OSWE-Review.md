## Introduction

After completing my OSEP exam in June, I didn't expect to take another Offsec certication so soon. But, my team won one the Asia Pacific Cyberattack Response Challenge 2023 and we were awarded Offsec vouchers as prizes. Thanks to [Cyber8lab](https://cyber8lab.com/) and [Offsec](https://www.offsec.com/) for sponsoring these prizes!

The Offensive Security web Expert (OSWE) certification, formerly known as Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation (WEB-300), is an advanced web application security course that teaches the skills needed to conduct white box web app penetration tests. If you are pursuing the Offensive Certified Expert (OSCE3), OSWE can be your first or next step in your certification journey.

You can get the full syllabus for OSWE (WEB-300) in [here](https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-300/download/syllabus).

Once you buy the course, you'll receive access to course materials such as PDFs, videos, and labs. In my opinion, I think you should have enough time with the 90-day period to go through all the course materials and complete the labs. 

For more details, Offsec already provide more explanation in [here](https://help.offsec.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046418812-OSWE-Exam-FAQ)

## Labs

Compared to the OSEP, the OSWE labs do not provide any flags for you to read and submit on their platform. But you will be able to hands-on in their labs and review the source code of each of the vulnerable web application.

Personally, I found it quite overwhelming as each of the labs contains thousands lines of code. Therefore, it's important to take your time to understand and exploit the vulnerabilities. The OSWE materials include walkthroughs for each of the labs, so I mainly went through the materials first and then proceeded with the labs.

During the first month, I manage to complete the first 5 modules with their labs and try to create an exploitation scripts for each of the labs. In the final month, I completed all the materials and some of the labs due to the time constraints that I have.

The most important part is to ensure all scripts, notes, references are well-documented on your machine. I'm using Visual Studio Code on my Kali machine to easily go through my exploitation scripts and notes which I can easily grep later using the following structure:

> CTF - Folder where I put all the scripts I encountered while playing CTF
{: .prompt-info }

> FastCopy - Folder where I will put all the important function that I can easily copy to start my exploitation scripts
{: .prompt-info }

> HTB_Other - Folder where I put all the full chain exploitation scripts for HTB labs or any vulnerable web app I encountered in the internet
{: .prompt-info }

> Labs - Folder where I put all the exploitation scripts for OSWE labs
{: .prompt-info }

But still, [CherryTree](https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/) will be the main app for my note taking üòÅ
