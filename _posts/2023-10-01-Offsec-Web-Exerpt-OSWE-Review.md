## Introduction

After completing my OSEP exam in June, I didn't expect to take another Offsec certication so soon. But, my team won one the Asia Pacific Cyberattack Response Challenge 2023 and we were awarded Offsec vouchers as prizes. Thanks to [Cyber8lab](https://cyber8lab.com/) and [Offsec](https://www.offsec.com/) for sponsoring these prizes!

The Offensive Security web Expert (OSWE) certification, formerly known as Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation (WEB-300), is an advanced web application security course that teaches the skills needed to conduct white box web app penetration tests. If you are pursuing the Offensive Certified Expert (OSCE3), OSWE can be your first or next step in your certification journey.

You can get the full syllabus for OSWE (WEB-300) in [here](https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-300/download/syllabus).

Once you buy the course, you'll receive access to course materials such as PDFs, videos, and labs. In my opinion, I think you should have enough time with the 90-day period to go through all the course materials and complete the labs. 

For more details, Offsec already provide more explanation in [here](https://help.offsec.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046418812-OSWE-Exam-FAQ)
